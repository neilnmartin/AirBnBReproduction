# AirBnBReproduction

A full reproduction of AirBnB's Experiences listing data and user interface.

Individual modules of this single page application have been assigned to their own microservice, each with its own vertically integrated full stack setup - built with NodeJS/Express-React-MongoDB/PostgreSQL. 
Please consult individual README files for setup.


## What I Learned:

The microservice architecture and development constraints of matching existing UI/UX involved in this application helped me learn:

- CSS from scratch, without the use of libraries
  - flex display and similar organization tools
- Using an external react modules (an enhanced carousel with a video embed capability)
- How to combine and pipe requests through a proxy NodeJS server
- Docker and containerization of microservices
- AWS management console and EC2 launch & management
