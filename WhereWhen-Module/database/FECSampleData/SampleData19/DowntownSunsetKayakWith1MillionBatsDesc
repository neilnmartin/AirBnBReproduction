We will put our kayaks into the water underneath I-35 and then paddle to the Congress Ave bridge which is the main event. We have plenty of time built into the tour to kayak the length of downtown and back to the bridge before the bats come out. We will travel to the bridge as a group and I'll lead and "out and back" paddle for an additional mile if you would like.... go as far as you want at your own pace and we'll re-group before the bats!
