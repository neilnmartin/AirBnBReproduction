You won't believe the tiny town of Galesville is just 30 miles from Washington, D.C.. While just relaxing on the placid Chesapeake is enough for most folks, we may see watermen harvesting seafood, lovely yachts sailing by, kayakers, water skiers, ospreys nesting or taking flight, herons and perhaps rays or dolphins . Come on Weds. night to view the yacht races! You can help me sail and steer or just watch the clouds roll by.
