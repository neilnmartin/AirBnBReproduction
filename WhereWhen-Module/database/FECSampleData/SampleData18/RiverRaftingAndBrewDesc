The Clackamas River is well known as one of the best places to enjoy outdoor activities within close proximity of the Portland, OR area. We love to share the area with others. We find it amazing that we have such a beautiful outdoor recreation mecca, so close to Oregon's largest city. The river and beer go together! There are many great breweries in Portland- and at the end of our river experience, we will visit one of our favorites.
