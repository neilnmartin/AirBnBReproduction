We will go to 2 unique cenotes, about 50 km from Cancun, deep in the 
Mayan jungle and hear as it is waking up.

I have personally hand-picked these because they are very representative of what cenotes are. There are over 2,500 cenotes in this region, most all of them are very similar. This is a great alternative of avoiding the famous and crowded cenotes (tourist trap)! And truly "AVOIDING THE CROWDS"!
