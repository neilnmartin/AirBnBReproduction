We'll head out along the coast exploring caves and secluded bays. 

Highlights (weather dependent) include:

Rainbow cave- A cavernous cave with a variety of colours on the walls. This cave has a waterfall for its entrance and often makes noises like a dragon breathing. 

Seal beach - In late August this beach has seal pups.

Needle Rock - A towering rock arch that can be paddled through. This sea stack has rare nesting birds in early summer.
