Sailing is the best way to get out of earth problems and relax in silence while the boat dance from wave to wave pushed by Ibiza's light winds. 
Anchor in front of the best beaches of Ibiza or Formentera is the best way to live this magic island experience.
You will be able to decide where you want to go but if you don't have preference, I'll bring you to my favorite places to show you my love of this live style.
